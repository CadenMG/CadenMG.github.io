I'm on an adventure to get back to being somewhat jack3d.

I started lifting in the summer of 2016 after my first girlfriend broke up with me, and fell in love it with almost instantly. Seriously. I was infatuated with lifting. During my first few months, there were weeks where I'd go 2 times per day, everyday of the week. I couldn't get enough it. It was maybe the first time in my life where I could see measurable progress towards a goal, and I just couldn't get enough of that feeling.

Not only did I spend hours in the gym, but I'd spend equally as much time (if not more) reading about lifting, nutrition, and exercise science. I was interested in lifting from multiple perspectives: the art, science, and practice.

During that time of intense focus, I gravitated towards this one popular lifter in the space Greg Nuckols. At the time, Greg was one of the main figureheads of "science-based" lifting. He wouldn't put his advice out there without a heavy backing of exercise science literature on the topic. I liked that a lot. But not only was Greg a science-based lifting advocate, he was a lifter himself, and a powerlifter at that.

As I consumed more and more powerlifting content, I couldn't help but admire how neat lifting heavy looked. And that was the beginning of the end. After my first summer of lifting, I headed off to college and was determined to get into this sport called powerlifting.

Pretty quickly I got my first belt, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, and chalk. I'd scour the web for the best programs, latest training tips, and whatever information I could get on how to put more pounds on the damn bar. It was a beautiful obsession, at least that's how I remember it.

By December of that year, I'd lost about 50lbs, and entered the 1000lb club after never having lifted before. I was elated. Powerlifting was my jam, and I was going to be the best at it.

This continued for another 2 years when I had the opportunity to transfer to a larger school that - guess what - had a competitive powerlifting team! I transferred, tried out, made the team, and got to enjoy the sport I loved with a group of 40 other men and women trying to add more lbs to the damn bar.

This is when shit gets a little rocky. I'm competitive, and if you can't already tell, I was really competitive about powerlifting. I wanted to beat everyone, doesn't matter how many years of experience you have over me or how big you are - I want to beat you badly.

This drive to beat others led me to gaining a lot of weight. If you don't know, there's a pretty linear relationship between your weight and your capacity to lift more. Higher body weight, more muscle, more capacity to lift more.

After my first year on team, I'd put on at least 20lbs, and not all of that was muscle ðŸ™‚. The pattern repeated on my second year where once again, I put on about 20lbs. By my third and final year, I added another 10lbs, putting me right back where I was before I started lifting (at least this time with *a lot* more muscle). That didn't feel great.

I realized that while powerlifting introduced me to a lot of great habits, it also instilled some toxic ones as well. I didn't like what I saw in the mirror after gaining back those 50lbs, and often times I wish I was just less competitive at some things.

After I graduated college, life just got busy. I couldn't find the motivation that I once had to stick out those hard training sessions, and they became less and less. Eventually, whether conscious or not I don't know, I just stopped going to the gym.

I've had small stints here and there of returning, but I haven't found a great way of making it stick like it once did. Oh, and the weight is still there. I'm roughly the same body weight that I was when I quit lifting. Not great.

But that's alright. That's why I'm writing this. I want to use this space as a bit of a brain dump for some of the hard questions that keep coming up every time I try to return the platform.

I'm going to give it a go. I want to get back to my former number, and do it in a healthy, sustainable way. For me, I think powerlifting should be a mechanism for getting into the gym, and getting into the gym is one of the greatest things you can do for your body.

I'll post weekly updates on how it's going. To start things off, my BW is at about 238lbs, no idea what my squat or deadlift is, and I benched 185 for a 5x5 yesterday.

Peace
