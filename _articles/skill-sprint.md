Skill Sprint is a challenge series where I try to achieve a certain amount of proficiency in a skill in a certain amount of time - where I share my thoughts and learnings along the way. For example, I could take 3 months and try to achieve a USCF rating of 1400. It's nice to time-box these so they don't consume too much of my life, and setting concrete proficiency goals makes achieving them very binary.

Most of my goals would be competitive in nature - board-games, sports, competitions, etc., but I'd like to explore other areas of skill like: languages and non-competitive games.

I'd like to add some element of stakes to the challenges as well, but don't have any concrete ideas yet. Regardless, for my first ever challenge in this series, I'll tackle a very old board game - Shogi!

Shogi, or Japanese Chess, is very similar to the Chess we know in many ways. If you're familiar with Chess, it's not a stretch to pick-up Shogi. I'll wait until my next post to highlight some of the key differences and learning methods I've used to reconcile those differences.

Now the end goal for this challenge will be: achieve a 1550 Lishogi rapid rating.

What is Lishogi?
For some background, I prefer playing my online chess on Lichess - it's an open-source, free platform for playing chess. Because that code is open-source, people have copied it and made variants for other games - in this case, Shogi.

Why rapid?
It's the most played time-control on the site, and I don't want to play games which last multiple hours!

Why 1550?
Based on my research of the rating distributions on the site, that would put my in the 50th percentile, and satisfy my craving for being "decent" at Shogi.

Now for the time allowed to complete this goal: I'm going to set a reasonable (at least I think reasonable...) deadline of end of next month. I'm mostly relying on my previous Chess skills to get me there, if you're a brand new player to both Chess and Shogi this may very unrealistic.

Alright, the stage is set and my plan is to post weekly updates on my progress towards a 1550 Lishogi rating. As of now, I haven't played a single non-computer game, but that will change very soon hopefully. See you next week :)
