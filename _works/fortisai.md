FortisAI is a mobile app for powerlifters who want to follow a scientific, data-driven path to strength.
At it's core, it's a tool for getting more out of your lifting data.
Fortis can measure the velocity of your lifts rep-by-rep and give you data informed RPEs tailored to your specific tendencies.
In the future I'd like to develop an LLM to actually chat with your data and serve any ad-hoc requests you might have.
For now, it's a simple, but powerful tool for getting more out of your lifting data.
