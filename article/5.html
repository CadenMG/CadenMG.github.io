<p>I’m on an adventure to get back to being somewhat jack3d.</p>
<p>I started lifting in the summer of 2016 after my first girlfriend broke up with me, and fell in love it with almost instantly. Seriously. I was infatuated with lifting. During my first few months, there were weeks where I’d go 2 times per day, everyday of the week. I couldn’t get enough it. It was maybe the first time in my life where I could see measurable progress towards a goal, and I just couldn’t get enough of that feeling.</p>
<p>Not only did I spend hours in the gym, but I’d spend equally as much time (if not more) reading about lifting, nutrition, and exercise science. I was interested in lifting from multiple perspectives: the art, science, and practice.</p>
<p>During that time of intense focus, I gravitated towards this one popular lifter in the space Greg Nuckols. At the time, Greg was one of the main figureheads of “science-based” lifting. He wouldn’t put his advice out there without a heavy backing of exercise science literature on the topic. I liked that a lot. But not only was Greg a science-based lifting advocate, he was a lifter himself, and a powerlifter at that.</p>
<p>As I consumed more and more powerlifting content, I couldn’t help but admire how neat lifting heavy looked. And that was the beginning of the end. After my first summer of lifting, I headed off to college and was determined to get into this sport called powerlifting.</p>
<p>Pretty quickly I got my first belt, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, and chalk. I’d scour the web for the best programs, latest training tips, and whatever information I could get on how to put more pounds on the damn bar. It was a beautiful obsession, at least that’s how I remember it.</p>
<p>By December of that year, I’d lost about 50lbs, and entered the 1000lb club after never having lifted before. I was elated. Powerlifting was my jam, and I was going to be the best at it.</p>
<p>This continued for another 2 years when I had the opportunity to transfer to a larger school that - guess what - had a competitive powerlifting team! I transferred, tried out, made the team, and got to enjoy the sport I loved with a group of 40 other men and women trying to add more lbs to the damn bar.</p>
<p>This is when shit gets a little rocky. I’m competitive, and if you can’t already tell, I was really competitive about powerlifting. I wanted to beat everyone, doesn’t matter how many years of experience you have over me or how big you are - I want to beat you badly.</p>
<p>This drive to beat others led me to gaining a lot of weight. If you don’t know, there’s a pretty linear relationship between your weight and your capacity to lift more. Higher body weight, more muscle, more capacity to lift more.</p>
<p>After my first year on team, I’d put on at least 20lbs, and not all of that was muscle 🙂. The pattern repeated on my second year where once again, I put on about 20lbs. By my third and final year, I added another 10lbs, putting me right back where I was before I started lifting (at least this time with <em>a lot</em> more muscle). That didn’t feel great.</p>
<p>I realized that while powerlifting introduced me to a lot of great habits, it also instilled some toxic ones as well. I didn’t like what I saw in the mirror after gaining back those 50lbs, and often times I wish I was just less competitive at some things.</p>
<p>After I graduated college, life just got busy. I couldn’t find the motivation that I once had to stick out those hard training sessions, and they became less and less. Eventually, whether conscious or not I don’t know, I just stopped going to the gym.</p>
<p>I’ve had small stints here and there of returning, but I haven’t found a great way of making it stick like it once did. Oh, and the weight is still there. I’m roughly the same body weight that I was when I quit lifting. Not great.</p>
<p>But that’s alright. That’s why I’m writing this. I want to use this space as a bit of a brain dump for some of the hard questions that keep coming up every time I try to return the platform.</p>
<p>I’m going to give it a go. I want to get back to my former number, and do it in a healthy, sustainable way. For me, I think powerlifting should be a mechanism for getting into the gym, and getting into the gym is one of the greatest things you can do for your body.</p>
<p>I’ll post weekly updates on how it’s going. To start things off, my BW is at about 238lbs, no idea what my squat or deadlift is, and I benched 185 for a 5x5 yesterday.</p>
<p>Peace</p>
